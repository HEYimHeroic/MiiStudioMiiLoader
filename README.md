# Mii Studio Mii Loader

Import and export Miis from Nintendo's online Mii Studio, using Mii Studio codes.

## Instructions

Make a new bookmark, and paste the following JavaScript code into the URL section of the bookmark:

```js
javascript:(function(){var s=document.createElement("script");s.setAttribute("src","https://heyimheroic.github.io/MiiStudioMiiLoader/miiLoader.js"),document.body.appendChild(s)})();
```

Once there, head to Nintendo's official Mii Studio site.

> You may have to enter the site via the My Nintendo site first. Make sure you're signed into your My Nintendo account.

Click on a Mii, click _"Edit"_, and click the bookmark you just made.

> Make sure that you're not making a new Mii. If you are, save the new Mii, and go back to edit it again.

Follow the instructions given to you in the popup box's prompt.

You can read more about the specifics on using the tool at the [Mii Library](https://sites.google.com/view/miilibrary/FAQ#h.pf4lefk6peji).
